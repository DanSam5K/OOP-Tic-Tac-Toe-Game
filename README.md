# OOP TIC TAC TOE GAME

A tic-tac-toe game was built to be played on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

### Main Objective

In this project, we built a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

## Game Intructions

After running in the terminal the command "bin/main.rb" to launch the game, follow the next steps:

1. First Player should put their name (Only numbers are not allowed as names)
2. Second Player should put their name (Only numbers are not allowed as names)
3. Now first player can pick a number from 1 to 9 as displayed on the board, followed by second player
4. Each of the players will take turns picking available numbers until a win condition is met
5. To win the game, the player must have a series of consecutive signs that can be, 3 consecutive horizontal cells, 3 consecutive vertical cells or either of the 2 diagonals
6. If no other moves are available and a win condition is not met, the game will end as a tie.

Here is an example of a game where x is the winner
